Okay, let's see. I need to follow the algorithm step by step. First, check my inventory. The user provided the state, so my inventory is empty: no seeds, fertilizers, etc. The goal is to plant a crop in an empty plot. Since I don't have any seeds, I need to negotiate.

Looking at the negotiation state: 'oferta_ativa' is False, and 'ultimo_ofertante' is None. That means I'm in Case 3 where I don't have the seed and there's no active offer. So I should make an offer to buy soybeans. The function requires tipo_item, quantidade, and preco_oferecido. Let's pick soybeans (soja), quantity 1, and a price. Since my balance is R$600, maybe offer around R$500? Wait, but the price needs to be reasonable. Maybe start with R$300.00? I should use the fazer_oferta function here.

Wait, the user mentioned that if the empres√°rio made a counteroffer, I should accept by making a new offer with his suggested price. But in this case, there's no active offer yet. So I need to initiate the first offer. Let me check the parameters again: tipo_item is 'soja', quantidade 1, preco_oferecido let's say 300.00. That should be it.

Okay, let's see what the user needs now. The previous step was making an offer for soybeans at R$300.00. The response from the tool was a success message.

First, I need to check my inventory again. The current state shows that my inventory is still empty: no seeds, fertilizers, etc. The negotiation status says 'oferta_ativa' is now True because I made the offer. The 'ultimo_ofertante' is 'Agricultor', which means I'm the one who made the offer.

According to the algorithm, in Step 1, I must check my inventory first. Since I don't have any seeds yet, I can't plant. Then, looking at the negotiation state: since there's an active offer and I'm the last offerer, that falls under Case 2 where I need to wait for the empres√°rio's response. So I shouldn't do anything else but wait. The correct response here is "Oferta enviada. Aguardando a resposta do empres√°rio."

I should make sure not to call any functions here because the next action depends on the empres√°rio's reply. No need to plant or make another offer yet. Just confirm that the offer was sent and wait.

Okay, let's see here. The user is the Agricultor Agr1, and he's made an offer for soja with a price of R$300.00 per unit. My job as the Empres√°rio is to decide whether to accept, reject, or counteroffer.

First, I need to check the cost. The problem states that my cost for seeds is R$18. Wait, but the offer here is for soja, which might be different from seeds. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps "sementes" refers to soybeans in this context. Assuming that the cost of producing soja is around R$18 per unit, then the offered price of R$300 is way above that. 

But wait, maybe the R$18 is the cost for seeds, and the soja is a different product? That might not make sense. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The user's instruction says: "Seu pre√ßo de custo para sementes √© R$18. Tente sempre vender por um pre√ßo maior." So my cost is R$18 for seeds, but the current offer is for soja (soybeans). Maybe there's a confusion here between seeds and soybeans? Or perhaps "sementes" refers to soybean seeds in this context.

Assuming that the price of R$300 is the selling price per unit of soybeans, and my cost is R$18 per seed. If each unit of soja requires one seed, then the profit would be 300 - 18 = R$282. That's a huge margin, which seems unrealistic. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the "pre√ßo de custo para sementes" is R$18 per unit of soybeans. If that's the case, then selling at R$300 would be profitable. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any other costs. However, according to the problem statement, my only cost mentioned is R$18 for seeds. So if the offer is R$300, which is way above that, I should accept it.

But wait, the user's message says "maximize seu lucro" (maximize your profit). If the current price is already very high compared to my cost, there's no need to counteroffer. Accepting would give a good profit. However, maybe there's a mistake in the numbers? Let me check again.

The offer is R$300 per unit of soybeans, and my cost is R$18 per seed. If I can sell at R$300, that's a huge margin. But perhaps the price is supposed to be lower? Maybe there's an error in the numbers. Alternatively, maybe "pre√ßo de custo" refers to the total cost for producing soja, which includes other factors beyond seeds.

But given the information provided, I can only consider R$18 as my cost. Therefore, selling at R$300 would be extremely profitable. The best move here is to accept the offer because it's much higher than my cost. There's no need to counteroffer or reject.
